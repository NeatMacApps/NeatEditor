> A minimal, fast-launching macOS plain text editor built with SwiftUI and AppKit for distraction-free writing, native desktop interactions, and efficient multi-tab editing.

## Why NeatEditor

NeatEditor is built around a simple goal: reduce interface noise and keep your attention on the text.

- Fast launch: avoid unnecessary blocking work on the app startup path.
- Space-first UI: keep the editor surface front and center instead of surrounding it with chrome.
- Native macOS behavior: preserve familiar title bar, menus, shortcuts, and window interactions.
- Plain-text focus: ideal for notes, drafts, scratch writing, and lightweight editing.

## Highlights

- Multi-tab plain text editing with a ready-to-use document on launch.
- Low-latency tab selection, closing, and in-place renaming.
- Open local text files through Finder, drag and drop, or pasted file URLs.
- Built-in line numbers, native find, undo, IME composition handling, and `Command +/-` zooming.
- Debounced autosave plus save-on-tab-switch and save-on-app-deactivation behavior.
- Pin-to-top window support and native title bar double-click zoom behavior.
- Disk-backed rename behavior that preserves editable file extensions.
- Blank content never overwrites existing files by design.

## Main Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Command + N` | Create a new document. |
| `Command + T` | Open another new tab. |
| `Command + O` | Open one or more local text files. |
| `Command + S` | Save the current tab immediately. |
| `Command + W` | Save and close the current tab. |
| `Shift + Command + T` | Reopen the most recently closed tab. |
| `Command + F` | Show the inline find bar for the current editor. |
| `Command + =` or `Command + +` | Zoom in the editor text. |
| `Command + -` | Zoom out the editor text. |
| `Command + ,` | Open Settings. |
| `Shift + Return` | Insert a new line at the end of the current line. |

Standard macOS text shortcuts such as `Command + Z`, `Command + X`, `Command + C`, and `Command + V` also work through the native text system.

## Current Status

NeatEditor is ready to use as a lightweight macOS plain text editor and is now being published as `1.0.0`.

- Platform target: macOS 15.0+
- Stack: Swift 6, SwiftUI, AppKit bridge, Observation, XcodeGen
- Validation today: build verification and manual testing
- Scope today: plain text workflow, no rich text, plugins, or cross-platform support

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- macOS 15.0+
- Xcode 16.2+
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) 2.44+

### Clone And Open

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd NeatEditor
xcodegen generate
open NeatEditor.xcodeproj
```

### Build From Terminal

```bash
xcodebuild -project "NeatEditor.xcodeproj" \
  -scheme "NeatEditor" \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'platform=macOS' \
  -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData \
  build
```

## Development Notes

- `project.yml` is the source of truth for the project structure.
- Run `xcodegen generate` after adding or removing source files.
- The repository does not yet include a test target, so `xcodebuild ... test` is not configured.
- For behavior changes, prefer validating with the built app rather than relying on previews alone.

## Releases

This repository includes a tag-driven GitHub Releases workflow.

- Push a tag like `v1.0.0` and GitHub Actions will build the release automatically.
- The workflow produces a macOS universal zip.
- The release also includes `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

The simplest release flow is:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

See [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md) for details.

## Known Gaps

These are reasonable next steps after the initial public release:

- Add a test target for save, rename, and state restoration flows.
- Add Apple code signing, notarization, and DMG packaging for smoother distribution.
- Add a general CI workflow for pushes and pull requests.
